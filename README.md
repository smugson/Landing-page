The webpage is designed with HTML and CSS follwing a designed template by the Odin Project. It is part of the fondation task in the odin project.
THE TASK taught me alot on the use of flexbox, much was also learnt on resizing images in a div which was a bit vhallenging before commencing and constant use of git and github.
